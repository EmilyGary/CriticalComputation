        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        This project is a depiction of the below description given by my
        colleague about a lost item: "I once had a mood ring I got at a
        carnival, but I lost it somewhere along the way. It was a thin gold band
        with an oval stone in the center. The stone’s color was somewhere
        between black and deep green. Sometimes the stone’s color turned purple,
        blue, red, orange, or yellow. I miss it.
      </p>

        Design Process

      <p>
        This project began with an exercise where my colleague Alex Modlin and I
        exchanged brief descriptions about an item we had lost in the past. With
        the above description, I first began to draw basic sketches of the mood
        ring to decide what view of it I wanted to depict. As I began sketching,
        I found that the story of the mood ring became increasingly important in
        order to personalize the depiction of the lost item.
      </p>

      <p>
        Functionally, I first began to draw directly in p5js, however had to
        take a step back as I realized that sketching would be a crucial step in
        translating the image into code. I attempted to draw the ring using
        basic shapes in order to simplify my mental model of the code required.
        The sketches were critical in determining which layers each element of
        the lost item belonged in since p5js drawing occurs from bottom to top
        layers unlike when drawing freehand. Assigning color to the work was
        less methodical and I played with different color combinations once the
        basic shapes were drawn out. I went a step further to include an
        interactive element to highlight the changing colors that Alex mentioned
        in his description of the mood ring.
      </p>

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        Alex's description of the lost item provided a variety of colors, which
        I wanted to include in my own depiction of the mood ring. The
        combination of the carnival setting and a mood ring gave me a sense of
        nostalgia, which I wanted to include by creating a classic image of a
        carnival tent with red and white stripes to provide context. I chose to
        leave the mood ring floating in space to highlight the wonder of where
        it ultimately may have ended up - neither here nor there. Both the mood
        ring and the setting were whimsical in Alex's description of the item.
        Inspired by the ever-changing aesthetic of mood rings, I wanted to
        mirror this in the work by making it interactive and displaying a wide
        range of color schemes. The cover photo portrays an air of mysticism and
        dark colors to note the loss, while the interactive display of the work
        gives a nod to the playfulness of mood rings and the carnival setting
        where it ultimately became a relic of a simpler time.

        Item description of the mood ring was provided by Alexander Modlin. All
        visual code was created by Emily Gary. p5js.org/references site was used
        in development as a reference and in development of interactive
        components.
