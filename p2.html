        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        This project explores applications of randomization in order to generate
        art. I chose to use a simple abstract drawing of a face with transparent
        shapes overlayed. The aspects of the face change with each click, and
        the shapes that are overlaid change color and position with each key
        press.
      </p>

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        I began first with a sketch of the faces and some potential variations
        that could be created using randomization. I decided to create certain
        fixed points within the sketch and use these as anchor points for
        different aspects of the face. For example, the curvature of the nose
        and the placement of the eye are anchored from the same position so that
        the face maintains its basic shape. These anchor points where used for
        the edge of the face and start of the hairline as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Initially, I had intended to change the curliness of the hair with each
        newly generated face, however this required many more inflection points
        in the curvature so I instead kept the same number of waves but make
        them increasingly more dramatic or smooth with each randomization.
      </p>

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        By using a simple and open-ended shape for the face, I found that this
        gave me a lot more room to leverage randomization throughout the piece.
        I was able to input broader ranges of randomization and in turn get more
        variety in each randomized face by starting with a simple shape that had
        room to move and be altered. I also found that for generating random
        colors, the hsb colormode provides a more aesthetically pleasing output
        than using rgb for randomization because the colors remain in one family
        of hues.
