        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        This project is based on the surrealist technique "exquisite corpse",
        where participants alternate drawing different parts of a figure without
        seeing what the others have drawn. We borrowed this same technique to
        create an exquisite corpse by combining the head, body, and legs of the
        figures drawn by three other classmates.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <i>The Scene</i>
      </h3>

      <p>
        Oh no! How could this have happened? And right before the meeting about
        the audit. Barry was suddenly panicked as he looked at his coworkers
        Panic Pete and Fashion Robot. All of their bodies had somehow gotten
        jumbled after they were using the new copy machine. There was no way
        Barry could go to his meeting wearing Fashion Robot's flamboyant shoes,
        and he especially could not pull off Panic Pete's shirtless look.
      </p>

      <p>
        Panic Pete shrugged it off, he didn't much care to worry about his own
        problems. Barry hurriedly put his shirt on over his new, squishier torso
        and begged Fashion Robot for a more reasonable set of shoes. They said
        they had extras at their desk, but were disappointed by the overall look
        Barry was sporting. Fashion Robot expressed concern that people would
        recognize their legs and this look would ruin their hard-earned
        reputation. After much arguing, Fashion Robot conceded to the black
        "office shoes" they kept at their desk for emergencies. Barry was in
        such a hurry to get to the audit that Fashion Robot intentionally
        neglected to tell him about the left shoe, which remained bright red.
        Barry wasn't used to changing eight shoes at once so it was easy to
        forget one. He was flushed red, so Fashion Robot put a little makeup on
        him so he would appear more collected. He hurried down the hallway to
        his meeting, hoping that no one would notice his strange appearance.

      <h3>
        The Characters
      </h3>

      <p>
        The three characters drawn by the other participants were Barry, Fashion
        Robot, and Panic Pete. Their pictures and descriptions are provided
        below:<br /><br />

        <b>Barry (Head) </b> <br />
        <i>by Franco Chen</i>
        <br />
        <br />
        This is Barry, your personal accountant. He filed your taxes incorrectly
        this year and because of him, the IRS is performing an audit on you.
        Barry doesn’t seem to mind, and he blames the audit on your excessive
        spending. You’re no accountant, but you think Barry is full of it.
        <br /><br />

        <b>Panic Pete (Body)</b> <br />
        <i>by Alex Modlin</i>
        <br /><br />
        Panic Pete is a kind enough sort. He has a flesh-colored, slightly
        bulbous body with blue balls for eyes and red balls for ears as well as
        nose. His body has some faint details of a clown outfit, but he doesn’t
        speak of this chapter in his life. It’s his business alone. Panic Pete
        is a wanderer now. He helps those dealing with their insecurities and
        core miseries release their tensions by allowing them to squeeze him.
        That is the power he has. He is Panic Pete. <br /><br />

        <b>Fashion Robot (Legs)</b> <br />
        <i>by Rachel Gorman</i>
        <br /><br />
        Fashion Robot is extra extra and that’s just how it likes it. It’s built
        to wear multiple sunglasses at a time. It has no arms, but a body made
        for draping capes. It has tons of feet so that it never has to choose
        between shoe options. It’s got two sets of ears for taking in all of
        your compliments, but it is always green with envy because it can’t wear
        your fabulous lewk along with its own. <br />

        Reflection
      </h2>

      <p>
        <i>Functions</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of functions makes the code a lot easier to understand,
        particularly when putting together multiple parts. Defining the
        functions felt much more intuitive to me and lead to a much cleaner
        result than previous projects.
