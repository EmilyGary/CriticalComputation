        This project is a nod to Seattle, which I consider my adult home after
        living in several places throughout my 20's. The project is inspired by
        the wildflowers of Mount Rainier shown in the photo below.

        Design Process
      </h2>
      <p>
        I chose to use a pattern from nature rather than a textile pattern for
        this project. The randomness of the placement is meant to reflect that
        seen in nature and I decided to let the pattern continue on in
        perpetuity to add a playfulness to the design.

        <!-- 4. reflection -->
      </p>

      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>
      <p>
        There is irony in translating a pattern from nature into digital form,
        which is representative of the current tumultous relationship between
        people, technology, and nature. The original photograph which inspired
        this design was taken at Mount Rainer National Park, unplugged from the
        technology that is constantly begging for our attention. The animation
        recontextualizes the pattern to fit it into our contemporary way of life
        which is dominated by technology. It reminds us that the digital world
        cannot replace all naturally occurring experiences and highlights the
        importance of taking abreak from our screens to enjoy nature in real
        life every once in a while.
