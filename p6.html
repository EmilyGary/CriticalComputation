        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        This project is inspired by the work of Georgia Lupi & Stefanie Posavec
        in Dear Data (2016.) They tracked different data about themselves and
        exchanged postcards for a year, turning their personal data into art.
        Using this same concept, I tracked my physical distance from my house 7
        times per day to see how much I am traveling in a typical week. Each
        circle represents a distance snapshot in time, with the size of the
        circle being determined by my distance from home. Each day of the week
        has it's own color.
      </p>

        Design Process
      </h2>
      <p>
        Rather than displaying this as a graph, I thought that the idea of
        distance and the floating circles would be more visually appealing if I
        created an outer space feel to the color scheme. Distance as represented
        by the size of the circles felt fairly straightforward, however I chose
        to add some interactivity to the sketch by making each row expand and
        display the day of the week when the mouse hovers over it.

      <h2>
        Reflection
      </h2>
      <p>
        This project made me appreciate the spontaneity of weekends, since there
        is a lot more variation in the distances I travel over the weekend. This
        project did lose some of the story since the data is just a snapshot in
        time. If I were to recreate this project, I would want to display the
        distances travelled over time or potentially overlay it on Manhattan so
        that I could see where I am traveling most often as well as how far I am
        going.
