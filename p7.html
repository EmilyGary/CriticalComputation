        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        This game is an autobiographical depiction of moving to Madrid, Spain
        with my dog, Hans. The game is meant to detail the struggles of being in
        a new place and the unexpected issues that arrise as you adjust to
        living in a new country.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>
      <p>
        When I moved to Madrid, Hans was the only creature I knew. With that, I
        decided to make him the protagonist of the game. Though there were many
        obstacles large and small as I adjused to my new home, I chose to
        integrate the smaller details into my game to make it more whimsical and
        preserve some of the smaller details of my memories in Madrid that I
        might otherwise forget.
        <br />
        I formatted the game in a Pacman format, with certain objects being good
        and others being bad. This choice allowed me to tell more of my story by
        incorporating the challenges and rewards into each scene. Initially, I
        wanted to add layers of complexity to the game, with different objects
        having "special" behaviors such as attractive forces, however after
        playing I realized that this added complexity without contributing
        anything specific to the overall game dynamics. I chose to use real
        photographs from Madrid as the backdrops for each scene to play up my
        nostalgia, and I thought that the combination of real photos with
        pixelated caricatures added to the ridiculousness of some of the scenes.
        Some initial story boards for the game are featured below, including a
        third story board which didn't make it to the final game. <br />

        Reflection
      </h2>
      <p>
        This game was a huge learning experience implementing object
        interactions, which has a lot more intricacy than I had initially
        thought. I also learned a lot about my own design process. I am much
        more efficient when I sketch out my ideas by hand before starting to
        code. Seeing the storyboards on paper helps me to quickly see what will
        work and what won't, and also helps me quickly decide which ideas I
        should move forward with. I also learned that I need to allocate more
        time for the visuals, since creating various objects can be quite
        time-consuming, particularly when I am trying to have a cohesive style
        throughout my game.
