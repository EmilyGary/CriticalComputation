        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        Sometimes the most difficult part of starting a new project is coming up
        with the idea. This project can be used as both a tool and a distraction
        when the well has run dry on good ideas. The design stems from my own
        struggles as a graduate student in design. I spend a lot of time
        brainstorming for projects, but the process of brainstorming can be so
        abstract that sometimes I feel guilty for "not doing anything". This
        experimental camera brings movement to the process of brainstorming in
        an attempt to alleviate the guilt that many of us have when we can't see
        physical results from our mental efforts. In creative practices, the
        concept is often the most important part. Whether your ideation is
        helpful or procrastination with better branding, the Brain Storm gives
        us something to show for it.

        Design Process
      </h2>
      <p>
        Originally, I sketched out some ideas that would transform the viewer
        into something else. The first three concepts were: 1. Display color in
        terms of molecules using the 4 molecules people are comprised of
        (hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen). 2. Overlay a map over the
        silhouette of the person to make a globe out of them. 3. Replace
        particular facial features with coins or money. However, I realized that
        these were missing interactivity, which is an important part of a
        filtered camera sketch. As I began brainstorming, I was inspired to
        create the Brain Storm camera. I created the clouds and lightning first,
        and played with different offsets to create a storm-like effect that
        doesn't cover the user's face. After the brain storm was complete, I
        sketched the lightbulb. I then tested how far apart the two lip points
        of the facial recognition need to be in order to detect someone saying
        "ah-hah!" I settled on a distance of 15 pixels, and realized as I was
        testing that the nose and eye features perfectly drew the wire component
        of the lightbulb. I chose to use this component of the face within the
        lightbulb to showcase the user as they are having their "ah-ha moment".

        Reflection

      <p>
        This assignment pulled back the curtain on the interactive filters which
        are ubiquitous in social media. It was both exciting and alarming to see
        how quickly and easily facial recognition can be implemented. In my
        case, the intention was primarily entertainment, but even my decisions
        in determining the distance between the lips while saying "ah-ha" could
        impact my users as they use the Brain Storm. I can easily see how these
        same sorts of judgement calls could lead to much graver outcomes when
        they are made for facial recognition for identification or security
        purposes as there was variability in this "critical distance" even when
        testing among a few friends. I also learned that for interactive
        sketches, testing is important and may generate new ideas for the final
        project along the way. I hadn't realized I could use the facial tracing
        as the interior of the lightbulb until I was testing the "ah-ha" moment.
