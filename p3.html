        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        This project is representative of the many ways in which we measure
        time. I chose to represent time in terms of a sun salutation yoga
        sequence. The clock is meant to be used as a motivator to get out of our
        seats and move -- a reminder that is often needed in our digital world.
      </p>

      <p>
        I experimented with a few different forms of representing time, however
        I chose the sun salutation yoga sequence because I feel that it is a
        nice reminder to use our bodies and practice self care, even if only for
        a minute, as many of us spend the majority of our days sitting and
        staring at a screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        I began by drawing the yoga sequence on paper, and then started with a
        basic human figure to ensure that the poses could be represented simply
        and clearly. I kept the body height and width consistent throughout each
        pose, and then used the hip and shoulder points as anchors to ensure
        consistency as the frames changed. After drawing the figures in p5, I
        added scrolling text using a time function. I selected the color scheme
        because I wanted the visual to create a calming effect for anyone
        following along.
      </p>

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        <i>Defining Variables</i>
        In an attempt to make drawing each pose easier, I defined variables
        using the width and height of the body as parameters. As the body needed
        to rotate, I found that the variables became more confusing to use over
        time. Upon reflection, it is better not to nest variables within
        eachother because that made it harder to visualize the distance each
        variable would offset the images.
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>Time Functions</i>
        In order to get the text to scroll across the screen uniformly, I
        utilized the millisecond feature paired with a tutorial using a global
        variable based on milliseconds (credited below.) I attempted to have the
        drawing loop through only once until clicked, but had a harder time
        using the timer technique with mousePressed in order to execute it. In
        addition, I plan to add a gong sound to signal when to change poses in
        future iterations of my experimental clock.
