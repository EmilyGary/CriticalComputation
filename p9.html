        Description
      </h2>

      <p>
        This interface is meant as a way to entertain, distract, or potentially,
        brain storm when you need to come up with a new idea. The interface
        intentionally dead ends when the user already has an idea since the
        Brain Storm camera is meant to help in the ideation process. If the user
        has an idea, then they should move on to execution. The interface
        contains interactive elements and ensures that the user is aware that
        their camera is about to turn on prior to beginning.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Design Process
      </h2>
      <p>
        I wanted the interface to have more awareness for the user since the
        first Brain Storm camera suddenly turns on the computer camera before
        explaining what it is. I chose to make the screens in the form of a
        logic tree since this chainlinking of questions and answers is
        reminiscent of the brain storming process. The buttons for each stage
        are not in the form of "Yes" and "No" to force the user to read what
        they are agreeing to rather than just clicking through and assuming
        where the "Next" button is. In the screen prior to accessing the camera,
        I wanted to have the user type out an uncommon phrase providing their
        consent to access the camera to ensure that they actually read through
        the instructions. If they have not read through the instructions, I
        didn't want to surprise them with a camera.

        Reflection
      </h2>
      <p>
        The interface is representative of the FRIES model for consent. My
        specific considerations are detailed below: <br />
        Freely Given: The user always has the option to go back or return to the
        home screen. <br />
        Reversible: Once the user gets to the camera screen, they have the
        option to click to turn off the camera and return home. In order to
        access their camera again, they must go through the consent screen again
        so the information is never stored for future use. <br />
        Informed: The user must read the screen in order to take the correct
        actions to continue forward. The description is written in plain
        language and not buried in legal terms. <br />
        Enthusiastic: The user literally has to write an enthusiastic phrase
        before giving access to their camera. <br />
        Specific: The phrase that the user writes details the level of consent
        that they are willing to give. <br />

        <br />
        This project involved a high level of thought just to allow access to
        the users camera. There is no data collection involved, yet I spent a
        lot of time thinking about the best ways to ensure the user provides
        consent prior to accessing their camera. This highlighted how much is
        not made transparent to users in their online activities, especially
        given that data collection is incredibly common for the majority of
        websites. There are much higher stakes for much of the data collection
        that goes on, yet much less detail and choice is given to the user
        before this data collection occurs.
        <br />
        The interface itself feels slow to get to the Brain Storm screen, which
        highlights how often we skip through important terms in order to get to
        what we want. People have become so accustomed to speed and reducing
        clicks that sometimes this comes at the cost of their own consent for
        access to their data or devices.
